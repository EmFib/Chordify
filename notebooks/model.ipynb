       "  'lyrics': \"Up on the white veranda She wears a neck tie and a panama hat Her passport shows her face from Another time and place she looks nothing like that And all of the remnants of her Recent past are scattered in the wild wind She walks across the marble floor where a Voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in She smiles walks the other way As the last ship sails and the moon fades away From Black Diamond Bay As the morning light breaks open The Greek walks down and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write Pardon monsieur the Desk Clerk says Carefully removes his fez am I hearing you right And as the yellow fog is lifting The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor She passes him on the spiral staircase Thinking he's the Soviet ambassador She starts to speak but he walks away As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway On Black Diamond Bay A Soldier sits beneath the fan doing Business with the Tiny Man who sells him a ring Lightning strikes the lights blow out The Desk Clerk wakes he begins to shout can you see anything Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his Barefeet with a rope around his neck While the loser in the gambling room Lights up a candle says open up another deck But the dealer says attendez vous sil vous plait As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away From Black Diamond Bay The Desk Clerk heard the Woman laugh as he Looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough He tried to grab the Woman's hand Said here's a ring it cost a grand she said that ain't enough Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a Horse drawn taxi waited at the curb She passed the door that the Greek had locked where a Hand written sign read Do not disturb She knocked upon it anyway As the sun went down and the music did play On Black Diamond Bay I've got talk to someone quick but the Greek said go away and kicked the chair to the floor He hung there from the chandelier she Cried help there's danger near please open up the door Then the volcano erupted and the Lava flowed down from the mountain high above The Soldier and the Tiny Man were Crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love The Desk Clerk says it happens every day As the stars fell down and the fields burned away On Black Diamond Bay As the island slowly sank the Loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room The dealer said it's too late now you can Take your money but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb The Tiny Man bit the Soldier's ear as the Floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew While she's out on the balcony where a Stranger tells her my darling je vous aime beaucoup She sheds a tear then begins to pray As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away On Black Diamond Bay I was sitting home alone one night in LA watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news It seems there was an earthquake there Left nothing but a panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes Didn't seem like much was happening so I Turned it off and went to grab another beer Seems like every time you turn around there's Another hard luck story that you're gonna hear And there's really nothing anyone can say And I never did plan to go anyway To Black Diamond Bay\"},\n",

       "  'lyrics': \"John Wesley Harding Was a friend to the poor He trav'led with a gun in ev'ry hand All along this countryside He opened a many a door But he was never known To hurt an honest man Twas down in Chaynee County A time they talk about With his lady by his side He took a stand Was all but straightened out For he was always known To lend a helping hand All across the telegraph His name it did resound But no charge held against him Could they prove Who could track or chain him down He was never known To make a foolish move As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine s I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains I offer'd her my hand she took me by the arm I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm Depart from me this moment I told her with my voice Said she But I don't wish to said I but you have no choice I beg you sir she pleaded from the corners of her mouth I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield And as she was letting go her grip up Tom Paine did run I'm sorry sir he said to me I'm sorry for what she's done I dreamed I saw St Augustine Alive as you or me Arise arise he cried so loud In a voice without restraint I dreamed I saw St Augustine Alive with fiery breath There must be some kind of way out of here Said the joker to the thief There's too much confusion I can't get no relief Business men they drink my wine Plow men dig my earth None of them along the line Know what any of it is worth No reason to get excited The thief he kindly spoke There are many here among us Who feel that life is but a joke But you and I we've been through that And this is not our fate So let us stop talking falsely now The hour's getting late All along the watchtower Princess kept the view While all the women came and went Barefoot servants too Outside in the cold distance A wildcat did growl Two riders were approaching And the wind began to howl All along the watchtower All along the watchtower All along the watchtower Well Frankie Lee and Judas Priest They were the best of friends So when Frankie Lee needed money one day Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens And placed them on a footstool Just above the plotted plain Sayin' Take your pick Frankie Boy My loss will be your gain Well Frankie Lee he sat right down And put his fingers to his chin But with the cold eyes of Judas on him His head began to spin Could ya please not stare at me like that he said It's just my foolish pride For sometimes a man must be alone And this is no place to hide Well Judas he just winked and said All right I'll leave you here But you'd better hurry up and choose Which of those bills you want Before they all disappear I'm gonna start my pickin' right now Just tell me where you'll be Judas pointed down the road And said eternity Eternity said Frankie Lee With a voice as cold as ice That's right said Judas Priest Eternity Though you might call it Paradise I don't call it anything Said Frankie Lee with a smile All right said Judas Priest I'll see you after a while Well Frankie Lee he sat back down Feelin' low and mean When just then a passing stranger Burst upon the scene Saying Are you Frankie Lee the gambler Whose father's deceased There's a fellow callin' you down the road And they say his name is Priest Oh yes he is my friend Said Frankie Lee in fright I do recall him very well In fact he just left my sight Yes that's the one said the stranger As quiet as a mouse Well my message is he's down the road Stranded in a house Well Frankie Lee he panicked He dropped ev'rything and ran Until he came unto the spot Where Judas Priest did stand What kind of house is this he said Where I have come to roam It's not a house says Judas Priest It's not a house it's a home Well Frankie Lee he trembled He soon lost all control Over everything which he had made While the mission bells did toll He just stood there staring At that big house as bright as any sun With four and twenty windows And a woman's face in every one Well up the stairs ran Frankie Lee With a soulful bounding leap And foaming at the mouth He began to make his midnight creep For sixteen nights and days he raved But on the seventeenth he burst Into the arms of Judas Priest Which is where he died of thirst No one tried to say a thing When they carried him out in jest Except of course the little neighbour boy Who carried him to rest And he just walked along alone With his guilt all well concealed And muttered underneath his breath Nothing is revealed Well the moral of the story The moral of this song Is simply that one should never be Where one does not belong So when you see your neighbour carryin' somethin' Help him with his load And don't go mistaking Paradise For that home across the road Oh help me in my weakness I heard the drifter say As they carried him from the courtroom And were taking him away My trip hasn't been a pleasant one And my time it isn't long What it was that I've done wrong Well the judge he cast his robe aside A tear came to his eye You fail to understand he said Why must you even try Outside the crowd was stirring You could hear it from the door While the jury cried for more Oh stop that cursed jury Cried the attendant and the nurse The trial was bad enough But this is ten times worse Just then a bolt of lightning Struck the courthouse out of shape The drifter did escape Dear Landlord please don't put a price on my soul My burden is heavy my dreams are beyond control When that steamboat whistle blows I'm gonna give you all I got to give And I do hope you receive it well Depending on the way you feel that you live Dear Landlord please heed these words that I speak I know you've suffered much but in this you are not so unique All of us at times we might work too hard To have it too fast and too much And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see But he just cannot touch Dear Landlord please don't dismiss my case I'm not about to argue I'm not about to move to no other place Now each of us has his own special gift And you know this was meant to be true And if don't underestimate me I won't underestimate you I am a lonesome hobo Without family or friends Where another man's life might begin That's exactly where mine ends I have tried my hand at bribery Blackmail and deceit And I've served time for ev'rything Cept beggin' on _ the street Well once I was rather prosperous There was nothing I did lack I had fourteen karat gold in my mouth And silk upon my back But I did not trust my brother I carried him to blame Which led me to my fatal doom Kind ladies and kind gentlemen Soon I will be gone But let me just warn you all Before I do pass on Stay free from petty jealousies Live by no man's code And hold your judgment for yourself Lest you wind up on this road I pity the poor immigrant Who wishes he would've stayed home Who uses all his power to do evil But in the end is always left so alone That man whom with his fingers cheats And who lies with ev'ry breath Who passionately hates his life And likewise fears his death I pity the poor immigrant Whose strength is spent in vain Whose heaven is like Ironsides Whose tears are like rain Who eats but is not satisfied Who hears but does not see Who falls in love with wealth itself And turns his back on me I pity the poor immigrant Who tramples through the mud Who fills his mouth with laughing And who builds his town with blood Whose visions in the final end Must shatter like the glass I pity the poor immigrant When his gladness comes to pass There was a wicked messenger From Eli he did come With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter He answered with his thumb For his tongue it could not speak but only flatter He stayed behind the assembly hall It was there he made his bed Oftentimes he could be seen returning With a note in his hand which read The soles of my feet I swear they're burning Oh the leaves began to fallin' And the seas began to part And the people that confronted him were many And he was told but these few words Which opened up his heart Down along the cove Down along the cove I spied my true love comin' my way Down along the cove Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy Down along the cove Down along the cove We walked together hand in hand Close your eyes close the door You don't have to worry any more I'll be your baby tonight Well that mockingbird's gonna sail away We're gonna forget it That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon But we're gonna let it you won't regret it\"},\n",

foundation I was standing upon Now there s spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain t no neutral ground The enemy is subtle how be it we are so deceived When the truth s in our hearts and we still don t believe Shine your light shine your light on me Shine your light shine your light on me Shine your light shine your light on me Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself I'm a little too blind to see My so called friends have fallen under a spell They look me squarely in the eye and they say All is well Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high When men will beg God to kill them and they won t be able to die Sister lemme tell you about a vision I saw You were drawing water for your husband you were suffering under the law You were telling him about Buddha you were telling him about Mohammed in one breath You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal s death Shine your light shine your light on me Shine your light shine your light on me Shine your light shine your light on me Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself I'm a little too blind to see Precious angel you believe me when I say What God has given to us no man can take away We are covered in blood girl you know our forefathers were slaves Let us hope they ve found mercy in their bone filled graves You re the queen of my flesh girl you re my woman you re my delight You re the lamp of my soul girl and you torch up the night But there s violence in the eyes girl so let us not be enticed On the way out of

3 4 They ask me how I feel And if my love is real And how I know I'll make it through And they they look at me and frown They'd like to drive me from this town They don't want me around Cause I believe in you They they show me to the door They say don't come back no more Cause I don't be like they'd like me to And I walk out on my own A thousand miles from home But I don't feel alone Cause I believe in you I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter I believe in you even though we be apart I believe in you even on the morning after O oh when the dawn is near ing Oh when the night is disappear ing Oh this feeling is still here in my heart Don't let me drift too far Keep me where you are Where I will always be renewed And that which you've given me today Is worth more than I could pay And no matter what they say I believe in you I believe in you when winter turns to summer I believe in you when white turn to black I believe in you even though I be outnumbered O oh though the earth may shake me Oh though my friends for sake me Oh even that couldn't make me go back Don't let me change my heart Keep me set apart From all the plans they do pursue And I I don't mind the pain Don't mind the driving rain I know I will sustain Cause I believe in you fade out 1 2 3 4 Sometimes I feel so low down and disgusted Can't help but wonder what's happenin' to my companions Are they lost or are they found Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon And there's a slow slow train comin' up around the bend I had a woman down in Alabama She was a backwoods girl but she sure was realistic She said Boy without a doubt have to quit your mess and straighten out You could die down here be just another accident statistic And there's a slow slow train comin' comin round the bend All that foreign oil controlling American soil Lookin round you it's just bound to make you embarrassed Sheiks walkin' around like kings wearing fancy jewels and nose rings Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris And there's a slow slow train comin' up around the bend Man's ego is inflated his laws are outdated They don't apply no more you can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin' In the home of the brave Jefferson turnin' over in his grave Fools glorifying themselves trying to manipulate Satan And there's a slow slow train comin' up around the bend Big time negotiators false healers and woman haters Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency All non believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion And there's a slow there s a slow train comin' up around the bend People starving and thirsting grain elevators are bursting Oh you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it They say lose your inhibitions follow your own ambitions They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it There's a slow slow train comin' up around the bend Well my baby went to Illinois with some bad talkin' boy she could destroy A real suicide case but there was nothin' I could do to stop it I don't care about economy I don't care about astronomy But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets There's a slow slow train comin' up around the bend fade out 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1

Old men turning their young daughters into whores Stripes on your shoulders Stripes on your back and on your hands Stripes on your shoulders Stripes on your back and on your hands Swords piercing your

gave names to all the animals In the beginning long time ago He saw an animal that liked to growl Big furry paws and he liked to howl Great big furry back and furry hair Ah think I'll call it a bear Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning in the beginning Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning long time ago He saw an animal up on a hill Chewing up so much grass until she was filled He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how Ah think I'll call it a cow Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning in the beginning Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning long time ago He saw an animal that liked to snort Horns on his head and they weren't too short It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull Ah I think I'll call it a bull Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning in the beginning Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning long time ago He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail Real dirty face and a curly tail He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big Ah think I'll call it a pig Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning in the beginning Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning long time ago Next animal that he did meet Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet Eating grass on a mountainside so steep Ah think I'll call it a sheep Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning in the beginning Man gave names to all the animals In the beginning long time ago He saw an animal as smooth as glass Slithering his way through the grass Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake 1 2 3 4 The iron hand it ain't no match For the iron rod The strongest wall will crumble and fall To a mighty God For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears It is only He who can reduce me to tears Don't you cry and don't you die And don't you burn Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right When He returns TURNAROUND Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow That it passes through He unleashed His power at an unknown hour That no one knew How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness Can I cast it aside all this loyalty and this pride Will I ever learn That there'll be no peace that the war won't cease Until He returns Surrender your crown on this blood stained ground Take off your mask He sees your deeds He knows your needs Even before you ask How long can you falsify and deny what is real How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned He's got plans of His own to set up His throne When a He returns fade out\"},\n",

       "  'lyrics': \"How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand Yes and how many times must the cannon balls fly before they're forever banned The answer my friend is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind How many years can a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea Yes and how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free Yes and how many times can a man turn his head pretending that he just didn't see The answer my friend is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind Yes and how many times must a man look up before he can see the sky Yes and how many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry Yes and how many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died The answer my friend is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind Well if you're travellin' in the north country fair Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline Remember me to one who lives there She once was a true love of mine Well if you go in the snowflake storm When the rivers freeze and summer ends Please see she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howlin' winds Please see for me if her hair hangs long If it rolls and flows all down her breast Please see for me if her hair hangs long That's the way I remember her best I'm a wonderin' if she remembers me at all Many times I've often prayed In the darkness of my night In the brightness of my day So if you're travellin' in the north country fair Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline Remember me to one who lives there She once was a true love of mine Come you masters of war you that build the big guns You that build the death planes you that build all the bombs You that hide behind walls you that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never have done nothin' but build to destroy You play with my world like it's your little toy You put a gun in my hand then you hide from my eyes Then you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly Like Judas of old you lie and deceive A world war can't be won and you want me to believe But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain Like I see through the water that runs down my drain You that fasten all the triggers for the others to fire Then you sit back and watch while the death count gets higher You hide in your mansions while the young people's blood Flows out of their bodies and gets buried in the mud You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled Fear to bring children into the world For threatening my baby unborn and unnamed You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins How much do I know to talk out of turn You might say that I'm young you might say I'm unlearned But there's one thing I know though I'm younger than you Even Jesus would never forgive what you do Let me ask you one question is your money that good Will it buy you forgiveness Do you think that it could I think you will find when your death takes its toll All the money you made won't ever buy back your soul And I hope that you die and your death will come soon I'll follow your casket through the pale afternoon And I'll watch while you're lowered into your death bed Then I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead Well I'm walkin' down the highway with a suitcase inmy hand Yes I'm walkin' down the highway with a suitcase in my hand Lord I really miss my baby she's in some far off land With my suitcase in my hand Well your streets are gettin' empty Lord your highway's gettin' filled And your streets are gettin' empty And your highway's gettin' filled Well I been gamblin' so long Lord I ain't got much more to lose Yes I been gamblin' so long Lord I ain't got much more to lose Well I'm bound to get lucky baby Or I'm bound to die tryin' Yes I'm a bound to get lucky baby Lord Lord I'm a bound to die tryin' Well the ocean took my baby My baby stole my heart from me Yes the ocean took my baby My baby took my heart from me So I'm a walkin' down your highway Just as far as my poor eyes can see Yes I'm a walkin' down your highway Just as far as my eyes can see Well the Lone Ranger and Tonto Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles Oh you five and ten cent women I got a real gal I'm lovin' Lord I ain't goin' down to no race track I don't have no sports car Well the wind keeps a blowin' me With my hat in my hand Well lookit here buddy And rob every bank you can see Oh where have you been my blue eyed son Oh where have you been my darling young one I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall Oh what did you see my blue eyed son Oh what did you see my darling young one I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin' I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall And what did you hear my blue eyed son And what did you hear my darling young one I heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warnin' Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin' Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin' Heard one person starve I heard many people laughin' Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall Oh who did you meet my blue eyed son Who did you meet my darling young one I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman whose body was burning I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded with hatred And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall Oh what'll you do now my blue eyed son Oh what'll you do now my darling young one I'm a goin' back out fore the rain starts a fallin' I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison Where the executioner's face is always well hidden Where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten Where black is the color where none is the number And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' But I'll know my song well before I start singin' And it's a hard and it's a hard it's a hard and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe If you don't know by now An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe It'll never do somehow When your rooster crows at the break of dawn Look out your window and I'll be gone You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on But don't think twice it's all right An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe The light I never knowed An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light babe I'm on the dark side of the road But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say To try and make me change my mind and stay We never did too much talkin' anyway But don't think twice it's all right So it ain't no use in callin' out my name gal Like you never done before An' it ain't no use in callin' out my name gal I can't hear you any more I'm a thinkin' and a wonderin' walkin' down the road I once loved a woman a child I'm told I give her my heart but she wanted my soul But don't think twice it's all right So long honey babe Where I'm bound I can't tell Goodbye's too good a word babe So I just say fare thee well I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind You could have done better but I don't mind You just kinda wasted my precious time But don't think twice it's all right Oxford Town Oxford Town Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down The sun don't shine above the ground Ain't a goin' down to Oxford Town He went down to Oxford Town Guns and clubs followed him down All because his face was brown Better get away from Oxford Town Oxford Town around the bend He come in to the door he couldn't get in All because of the color of his skin What do you think about that my frien' Me and my gal my gal's son We got met with a tear gas bomb I don't even know why we come Goin' back where we come from Oxford Town in the afternoon Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune Two men died neath the Mississippi moon Somebody better investigate soon Oxford Town Oxford Town Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down The sun don't shine above the ground Ain't a goin' down to Oxford Town Some time ago a crazy dream came to me I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three I went to the doctor the very next day He said it was a bad dream I wouldn't worry bout it none though I said Hold it Doc a World War passed through my brain He said Nurse get your pad this boy's insane He grabbed my arm I said Ouch He said Tell me about it Well the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast It was all over by quarter past I was down in the sewer with some little lover When I peeked out from a manhole cover Wondering who turned the lights on Well I got up and walked around And up and down the lonesome town I stood a wondering which way to go And walked on down the road It was a normal day Well I rung the fallout shelter bell Give me a string bean I'm a hungry man I know I look funny Down at the corner by a hot dog stand He screamed a bit and away he flew Thought I was a Communist Well I spied a girl and before she could leave Let's go and play Adam and Eve I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin' When she said Hey man you crazy or sumpin' You see what happened last time they started Well I seen a Cadillac window uptown And there was nobody aroun' I got into the driver's seat In my Cadillac Well I remember seein' some ad So I turned on my Conelrad But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill Turned on my player I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue I needed somebody to talk to So I called up the operator of time Just to hear a voice of some kind When you hear the beep Well the doctor interrupted me just about then Sayin Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams But mine was a little different you see I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me I didn't see you around Well now time passed and now it seems Everybody's having them dreams Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours Honey just allow me one more chance To get along with you Ah'll do anything with you Well I'm a walkin' down the road With my head in my hand I'm lookin' for a woman Needs a worried man Just a one kind favor I ask you Low me just a one more chance Honey just allow me one more chance To ride your aeroplane Honey just allow me one more chance To ride your passenger train Well I've been lookin' all over For a gal like you I can't find nobody So you'll have to do Just a one kind favor I ask you Honey just allow me one more chance To get along with you Honey just allow me one more chance Ah'll do anything with you Well lookin' for a woman That ain't got no man Is just lookin' for a needle Just a one kind favor I ask you Low me just a one more chance Well I took me a woman late last night Well sometimes I might get drunk I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed Well my telephone rang it would not stop Well I got a woman sleeps on a cot Oh there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy Late one day in the middle of the week Now the man on the stand he wants my vote Oh set me down on a television floor Well the funniest woman I ever seen Well ask me why I'm drunk alla time\"},\n",

Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a rolling in And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train In your busted down Ford and your platform heels I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet Ah but you were right It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel Well we drove that car all night into San Anton' And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get Well we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the And she don't want to remind me She knows this car would go out of control Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls teeth like pearls

a wreckin' lot Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust She said Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of But ya know she changed the subject every time money came up She said Welcome to the land of the living dead You could tell she was so broken hearted She said Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt How far are y'all going Ruby asked us with a sigh We're going all the way til the wheels fall

       "  'lyrics': \"Well there was this movie I seen one time About a man riding cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck Well the marshal now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a rolling in And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert In your busted down Ford and your platform heels I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet Ah but you were right it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel Well we drove that car all night into San Anton' And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off Well we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man And she don't want to remind me she knows this car would go out of control Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above Brownsville girl show me all around the world Brownsville girl you're my honey love Well we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live he owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust She said Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started But she changed the subject every time money came up She said welcome to the land of the living dead you could tell she was so broken hearted She said even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt How far are y'all going Ruby asked us with a sigh We're going all the way til the wheels fall off and burn Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies Ruby just smiled and said ah you know some babies never learn Something about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved And a

       "  'lyrics': \"She was from Haiti fair brown and intense I don t think she d ever known about innocence I was playin a show in Miami in the theater of mystery Told her about Jesus told about the rain She told me about the vision told me about the pain That had risen from the ashes and abided in her memory Was she a virtuous woman I really can t say Something about her said trust me anyway As the days turned to minutes and the minutes turned back into hours I pretended to be sleeping and he thought I was But I was only paying attention like a rattlesnake does When he s hearin footsteps trampling on the flowers And that Caribbean wind still blows from Mexico to Curaçao From Chinatown to the furnace of desire And them distant ships of liberty on the iron waves so bold and free Bringing everyone that's near to me closer to the fire Well our shadows move closer til they touched on the floor The Prodigal Son s waiting close to the door Preaching up sanity he s waiting for the night to arrive He was well connected but her heart was a snare She had left him to die in there But I knew I could get him out while he still was alive Stars on my balcony flies buzz my head Ceiling fan s broken there s heat in my bed Street band playin' Nearer My God To Thee She looked into my eyes I hear the mission bells ring She said I know what you're thinking but there ain't a thing You can do about it so you might as well let it be When the Caribbean wind still blows from Mexico to Curaçao From Chinatown to the furnace of desire And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free Bringing everything that ever was close to me closer to the fire Atlantic City by the cruel sea I hear a voice crying Daddy I always think it's for me But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that calls Every new messenger bringin evil report About armies that are rioting those fuses are short And them ugly gargoyles and hate words written on walls Would I have married her I don't know I suppose She had bells in her braids and fire in her clothes But the curtain was rising like they say the show must go on Then I felt it come over me some kind of gloom I was going to say Come on with me I got plenty of room But I knew I'd be lyin' and besides she'd already gone And them Caribbean wind still blows from Curaçao to Mexico From Chinatown to the furnace of desire And them distant ships of liberty on iron waves so bold and free Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire\"},\n",
